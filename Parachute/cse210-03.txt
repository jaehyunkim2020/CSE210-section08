Program must have 4 classes, README file, classes and method comments

classes are, parachute, word, guesses, play

guesses
-keeps track of the guesses that have been guessed
-aka keeps a list that adds the guesses that have been guessed.
-could have a function in it that only allows new letters to be guessed
-prints out the letters that have been guessed

so the whole layout of the thing needs to get printed out
Theres a parachute which keeps track of the ammount of strings/chances you have left
all it needs as an input is a true or false. If false, then it subtracts. If true, nothing happens
to the parachute, but the word gets revealed
-prints the parachute
-chances are set
-checks to see if letter was guessed, subtracts


Then theres the word, it needs to be randomly generated and then split into a list with individual letter strings
The guess needs to be checked against the word to see if the word has any of the letters in it
That can be done with a for statement.
-generate random word
-seperates it into a list?
-asks for the guess
-check if the guess is in the word, returns true or false
-prints out the word, revealing letter by letter


play function
-play function?
-sets the parachute
-sets the word
-asks for the word.guess() returns true or false and modifies the word.revealed(), which prints it
-parachute.guess(boolean) which prints it
